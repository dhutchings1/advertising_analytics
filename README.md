# Advertising Analytics Project

Advertising Analytics Dashboard: https://dhutchings.shinyapps.io/advertising_analytics/

## Recommendations

### 1. Desktop ads
Desktop ads thrived according to several different metrics. The advertising analytics dashboard shows that Desktop ads consistently had higher conversion value per mille scores than other devices, meaning that they produce more value per 1000 impressions. Additionally, my regression results found that Desktop impressions had the greatest impact on increasing daily conversions compared to other devices. My hypothesis for why Desktop ads are better for generating conversions is that it is easier to buy items on a computer compared to a phone or tablet. More knowledge about the product would likely reinforce this hypothesis.

### 2. Creative Ids: 13, 55, 16, 15, 54
The advertising analytics dashboard shows that these are the best performing creative ids in terms of conversion value per mille. Without knowing more about these creative ids, it is hard to explain why they were successful. 

### 3. Ad Unit Id: 532
Ad unit id 532 had a shockingly high conversion value per mille value of $400, which made it an outlier. I looked deeper into that specific ad unit and found that it ran on 1/30 and 1/31 and had only 2 total conversions and 325 impressions. Additionally, I noticed that ad unit id 532 was expensive. I calculated the ratio of impressions over publisher split to give an indication of how many impressions the ad could get per $1 paid to the publisher. On average, ad unit id 532 had a ratio of 97, which was significantly less than the average of the complete dataset, which was 1,066. My hypothesis is that this was a high quality ad unit, which explains why it had a high conversion value per mille value.

## Observations

### Desktop ads cost more than other devices
This didn't surprise me given that Desktop ads deliver more conversion value per mille.

### Ad spending increased in January
I observed a sharp increase in daily impressions and publisher split costs in mid to late January.

### Local peak in daily conversions around black friday (11/26 - 11/29)
This is expected because the advertised product was likely hosting sales around that time
